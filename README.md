# WeatherApp
This is a weather app I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Upon visiting the website, the browser will prompt the client for access to their location and display the weather, humidity, and wind speed for the current city. It also can display the weather in any city via search bar. It uses an API from openweather.com.
